RESEARCH SCHOLAR UNDER PROF. ANIMA ANANDKUMAR July 2020 - Present
« Working on the interface of Game Theory/Mechanism Design and Deep Learning.
Microsoft India (R&D), Bangalore Bangalore, India
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN May. 2020 - Jul. 2020
« Implemented an ADF pipeline for the Demand Forecasting Problem, which loaded inventory snapshots and
deltas from ADLS Gen 2 storage, performed suitable transformations and various analytics algorithms.
Performed Statistical Analysis and modelling on inventory data in Databricks to output useful insights.
« Linked the ADLS Gen 2 storage to Azure Data Share and enabled cross subscription sharing of snapshots for
transfer of data between the consumer storage and Open Logistics Platform platform in a scheduled fashion.
« Linked the output ADLS Gen 2 storage to Power BI (Business Intelligence) to load the prediction data. Created
an interactive dashboard for visualisation of the predictions and insights obtained.
National University of Singapore Kent Ridge, Singapore
VISITING RESEARCH SCHOLAR UNDER PROF. DJORDJE JEVDJIC May. 2019 - Jul. 2019
* Contributed to the design of an open-source DNA-based archival storage tool.
« Implemented a distributed and subquadratic algorithm to compute the underlying clusters in a DNA pool,
which converged efficiently on real and synthetic datasets and was robust to outliers and high levels of noise.
« Simulated the process of storing error-sensitive compressed image files into DNA reconstructing the image
from noisy amplified DNA strands. Improved the accuracy of existing DNA Clustering Algorithms by 10%.
Nutanix Summer of Code

Projects
Siamese BERT for Common Sense Reasoning and Validation Accepted Paper
CS6980 TERM PROJECT UNDER PROF ASHUTOSH MODI Jan. 2020 - Mar. 2020
« Proposed a system for Task 4: >Commonsense Validation and Explanation” of SemEval 2020, involving
differentiating between natural language statements that confirm to common sense and those that do not.
« Developed a Siamese model based on transformer neural network architecture, which was able to select the
against common sense statement and identify the most crucial reason why a statement does not make sense.
« Paper accepted at International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020.
Comparison of SGD Variants for Stochastic Optimization Term Paper
EE609A TERM PROJECT UNDER PROF KETAN RAJAWAT Mar. 2020 - May 2020
« Reproduced and extended the results of “On the Insufficiency of Existing Momentum Schemes for Stochastic
Optimization” by Kidambi et al., published in ICLR 2018.
« Showed experimentally that there exist simple stochastic problem instances where momentum based methods are sub-optimal and enjoy practical gains over SGD in deep learning applications due to minibatching.
« Established that ASGD and Adam can converge faster than all other methods irrespective of Batch Sizes.
GANs for scRNA sequences Delhi, India
SELF PROJECT UNDER PROF. DEBARKA SENGUPTA, IIIT DELHI Dec. 2019 - Jan. 2020
- Implemented a single cell RNA-seq data based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture.
« The model learned non-linear gene-gene dependencies and used them to determine the missing cell states.
DeCaptcha
CS771 COURSE PROJECT Oct 2019
« Used OpenCV for contour detection and image segmentation to break captcha into individual letters.
« Trained a three-layer CNN model for character recognition on 2000 images with 99% accuracy on the test set.
Smart Tutor
PROJECT UNDER PROF. VIPUL ARORA Dec 2018 - Feb 2019
